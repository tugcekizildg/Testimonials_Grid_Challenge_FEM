          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
          staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
          agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way
